# This class is the consistent interface for a node to obtain its
# cookbooks by name.
#
# This class is basically a glorified Hash, but since there are
# several ways this cookbook information is collected,
# (e.g. CookbookLoader for solo, hash of auto-vivified Cookbook
# objects for lazily-loaded remote cookbooks), it gets transformed
# into this.
class Chef
  class CookbookCollection < Hash

    # The input is a mapping of cookbook name to Cookbook object. We simply
    # extract them
    def populate(cookbooks)
      cookbooks.each{ |cookbook_name, cookbook| self[cookbook_name] = cookbook }
    end
    
  end
